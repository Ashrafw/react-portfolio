                        In my web development journey, I focus on the users by developing
                        well-designed interfaces that are both advanced and simple to
                        navigate. Front-end web development is a true passion of mine. I
                        truly enjoy the ever-changing landscape that requires constant
                        learning and application.

                        I have graduated with a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from
                        Kingâ€™s College London. I have a deep passion for computer
                        programming and design. I'm a bit of a math nerd and successfully
                        taught GCSE and A-level Maths to over 80 students privately in the
                        past few years.

                        After discovering how web development combines design elements and
                        technical complexity to produce a product that can be moulded into
                        anything a user/customer wishes, I became a web developer. I love
                        the freedom it provides, where an idea becomes a design, and from
                        a design to implementing coding stacks that develop a
                        pixel-perfect product.

                        have been fortunate to have a wide range of experiences that I can
                        call on during this journey, experiences and skills acquired from
                        working in research, education, engineering, and sales.
